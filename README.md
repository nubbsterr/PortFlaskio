# PortFlaskio
A repo dedicated to my very own portfolio webpage, built on Flask, HTML and CSS :D

# What is it? ðŸ¤”
PortFlaskio is literally just my portfolio site. That's it. The sole purpose of this repo is to comemorate it and make it more public :)

# Where can I find it then? ðŸ‘€
Currently, it's still in development. As of writing this README, I've got the basic HTML and CSS going, but no social links yet. If you guys wish to recommend features for the site, you can do so by messaging me on Discord with my username: <strong>nubbieeee</strong> :D
