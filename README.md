# PortFlaskio
A repo dedicated to my very own portfolio webpage, built on Flask, HTML and CSS :D

# What is it? ðŸ¤”
PortFlaskio is literally just my portfolio site. That's it. The sole purpose of this repo is to comemorate it and make it more public :)

# Where can I find it then? ðŸ‘€
As of writing, the site is LIVE!!! I'm hosting it using PythonAnywhere, it took a bit of time, but it's actually pretty easy to set up once you look back at it. The site is linked on this repo's description, but if you don't wanna look up and smash that link. <a href="https://nubb.pythonanywhere.com" target="_blank">You can find it right here :)</a>
